Patti LuPone and Seth Rudetsky: Broadway At The Art House - Provincetown, MA - July 4 and 5, 2012

Pro-Shot
{: .label .label-green }

NOTES
: Patti LuPone makes her Art House debut with Seth Rudetsky at the piano. This show was part of a series of 10 unrehearsed shows produced and hosted by Seth which featured him asking a series of questions of his guests (other shows included Audra McDonald, Betty Buckley, Andrea Martin, Judy Kuhn, Alice Ripley, and Meghan Mullally), then running to the piano to illustrate a point, or just an excuse for the guest to sing a song. Patti had no idea what he would ask, or what she would be asked to sing. This disc was edited from 4 shows they did together and highlights the best of the best. Filmed using multiple cameras.

{: .fw-500 .text-grey-dk-300 .text-gamma .d-inline-block }

FORMAT
: VOB+smalls `1 DVD` `1.34 GB`

NOTES
: EXCLUSIVE! Davis Gaines, Rachel York, Jason Graae, Valerie Pettiford, Cathy Woo. Hosted by Marc Cherry (Desperate Housewives, The Golden Girls…) in his own home, this benefit raised money for LA’s newest theatrical venue in a casual setting before invited guests. Marc’s house is packed with celebrities, and it’s fun to play “who’s who?” before the show starts.  The five artists perform a mix of Broadway standards, and original music written just for the occasion (There is a hilarious piece, written by Marc Cherry, called “Friday The 13th, The Musical”, in which Jason Graae plays “Jason Voorhees”, and sings a selection of Broadway standards to a new set of lyrics.)  This has the look and feel of a home movie, and it offers an interesting glimpse at a Hollywood party.  About The Festival of New American Theatre: “The Festival was founded in 2006 by Marcia Seligson, Producing Artistic Director of Los Angeles’ Reprise! By 2006 it was clear to Seligson that a renaissance in American theater was beginning to happen. Wicked had debuted on Broadway and was drawing huge audiences dominated by teenagers who had never seen a Broadway musical before. Where previously only a handful of successful musicals were “new” and ”American” now the number had doubled and tripled in a few short years. Away from Broadway, a new generation of composers, lyricists and book writers were beginning to attract a substantial following. Names like Adam Guettel, Jason Robert Brown, Ricky Ian Gordon and Michael John LaChiusa were having shows produced off Broadway, on college campuses and in small theaters around the country. Where Reprise! was dedicated to revivals of classic American musicals, Seligson decided it was the right time to develop an event to celebrate “the new” and to showcase the enormous body of creative and performing talent they had discovered in Southern California during the first decade of Reprise!”  About 45 minutes.

CAST
: Tom Kitt with Kelli O'Hara, Aaron Tveit, Alice Ripley, Amy Spanger, Gavin Creel, Billy Porter, Amanda Green, Jenn Colella, Julia Murney and Brooks Ashmanskas

NOTES
: Shot in 16:9 widescreen. The first song was filmed a bit too dark (forgot to change settings), and the second song is audio-only (I don't remember why), but the rest of the concert video is intact. The video is steady with close zooms. No obstructions on main performers, but off-stage singers in a couple of the group numbers could not be filmed. Great music written by Tom Kitt (including songs from Next To Normal and High Fidelity), performed by some of the greatest talents on Broadway. (My personal favorite is Julia Murney's "Perfect".)
