NOTES
: Filmed in 16:9 widescreen, almost no obstructions except for a head on the edge of the widest shots. Only very brief drop-outs for applause. Super fun for fans of the show to see the version before it came to Broadway. This is the only known full video of this pre-Broadway production. Yes, there is a typo in Andrew Keenan-Bolger's name in the video's cast list. Sorry. Audio fed in from external source, so the audio is nice and clear. Do not identify master or exact date.
