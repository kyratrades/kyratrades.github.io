MASTER'S NOTES
: This proshot from the start, in terms of being filmed from the huge screens. It is a very nice capture and has great closeups. Not as crystal clear as one might hope, but very enjoyable, with only minor impurities here and there, but pretty steady. Lea was the standout here, just amazing. A-

The video is very steady throughout and the sound is excellent as usual. It's filmed in 16:9 with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. Includes curtain call and Matt and Emily's very entertaining BC/EFA speech.

Young (Piragua Guy), Sharlane Conner, Willie Garner, Jesse Jones, Ashleigh King, Rebecca Kritzer, Briana Taylor

MASTER'S NOTES
: Super fun seeing this show with Robin de Jesús as Usnavi! Plus a number of understudies for this performance. Steady, clear 1080p HD 16:9 widescreen capture with minimal obstruction, only a couple of heads on the farthest downstage and sides of the stage. Mix of wides, medium, and close zooms to capture individual performances and ensemble numbers (the choreography was fun!). First minute or so of each act is audio only due to ushers, very few dropouts otherwise. Audio of a fundraising speech at the end of the show. Audio fed in from external source so it's super clear.

MASTER'S NOTES
: Filmed in 1080p HD 16:9 widescreen a couple weeks before the show closed. Very difficult to shoot around heads of some tall people, so quite a bit of obstruction in some scenes, but shot around as best as possible. Fun show, great energy from the cast as well as the audience who was loving every moment. First 30 seconds of Act 1 and first four minutes of Act 2 are audio only due to house lights being up. Audio fed in from external source so it's super clear.

NOTES
: The musical is performed  as a staged concert reading. Rather than one person per role, the concert is done with some of Broadway's best alternating in the roles. For the second show, they had a video screen projecting a nice wide shot of the entire show. Video is a clear and unobstructed screen capture of the show. Tapers camera went out during the song "Suck It", so only the first minute of this song is captured. Picks right back up at the intro/beginning of the next song, "With You." Otherwise a great quality capture.  Originally planned as a one night only event, this was filmed on the second night of the world premier presentation of this new musical.   A-

NOTES
: EXCLUSIVE! Davis Gaines, Rachel York, Jason Graae, Valerie Pettiford, Cathy Woo. Hosted by Marc Cherry (Desperate Housewives, The Golden Girls…) in his own home, this benefit raised money for LA’s newest theatrical venue in a casual setting before invited guests. Marc’s house is packed with celebrities, and it’s fun to play “who’s who?” before the show starts.  The five artists perform a mix of Broadway standards, and original music written just for the occasion (There is a hilarious piece, written by Marc Cherry, called “Friday The 13th, The Musical”, in which Jason Graae plays “Jason Voorhees”, and sings a selection of Broadway standards to a new set of lyrics.)  This has the look and feel of a home movie, and it offers an interesting glimpse at a Hollywood party.  About The Festival of New American Theatre: “The Festival was founded in 2006 by Marcia Seligson, Producing Artistic Director of Los Angeles’ Reprise! By 2006 it was clear to Seligson that a renaissance in American theater was beginning to happen. Wicked had debuted on Broadway and was drawing huge audiences dominated by teenagers who had never seen a Broadway musical before. Where previously only a handful of successful musicals were “new” and ”American” now the number had doubled and tripled in a few short years. Away from Broadway, a new generation of composers, lyricists and book writers were beginning to attract a substantial following. Names like Adam Guettel, Jason Robert Brown, Ricky Ian Gordon and Michael John LaChiusa were having shows produced off Broadway, on college campuses and in small theaters around the country. Where Reprise! was dedicated to revivals of classic American musicals, Seligson decided it was the right time to develop an event to celebrate “the new” and to showcase the enormous body of creative and performing talent they had discovered in Southern California during the first decade of Reprise!”  About 45 minutes.
