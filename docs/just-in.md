Jawbreaker: The Musical, In Concert - Los Angeles, CA - July 30, 2010

Craig, Nick Galbraith, Katie Kern, Jen Malenke, Lesli Margherita, Vic Mazzone, Aaron Neely, Leslie Odom, Jr., Jackie Seiden

NOTES
: The musical is performed  as a staged concert reading. Rather than one person per role, the concert is done with some of Broadway's best alternating in the roles. For the second show, they had a video screen projecting a nice wide shot of the entire show. Video is a clear and unobstructed screen capture of the show. Tapers camera went out during the song "Suck It", so only the first minute of this song is captured. Picks right back up at the intro/beginning of the next song, "With You." Otherwise a great quality capture.  Originally planned as a one night only event, this was filmed on the second night of the world premier presentation of this new musical.   A-

The Festival of New American Musicals Benefit - Los Angeles, CA - January 19, 2009
{: .fw-500 .text-grey-dk-300 .text-gamma .d-inline-block }

FORMAT
: VOB+smalls `1 DVD` `1.34 GB`

NOTES
: EXCLUSIVE! Davis Gaines, Rachel York, Jason Graae, Valerie Pettiford, Cathy Woo. Hosted by Marc Cherry (Desperate Housewives, The Golden Girls…) in his own home, this benefit raised money for LA’s newest theatrical venue in a casual setting before invited guests. Marc’s house is packed with celebrities, and it’s fun to play “who’s who?” before the show starts.  The five artists perform a mix of Broadway standards, and original music written just for the occasion (There is a hilarious piece, written by Marc Cherry, called “Friday The 13th, The Musical”, in which Jason Graae plays “Jason Voorhees”, and sings a selection of Broadway standards to a new set of lyrics.)  This has the look and feel of a home movie, and it offers an interesting glimpse at a Hollywood party.  About The Festival of New American Theatre: “The Festival was founded in 2006 by Marcia Seligson, Producing Artistic Director of Los Angeles’ Reprise! By 2006 it was clear to Seligson that a renaissance in American theater was beginning to happen. Wicked had debuted on Broadway and was drawing huge audiences dominated by teenagers who had never seen a Broadway musical before. Where previously only a handful of successful musicals were “new” and ”American” now the number had doubled and tripled in a few short years. Away from Broadway, a new generation of composers, lyricists and book writers were beginning to attract a substantial following. Names like Adam Guettel, Jason Robert Brown, Ricky Ian Gordon and Michael John LaChiusa were having shows produced off Broadway, on college campuses and in small theaters around the country. Where Reprise! was dedicated to revivals of classic American musicals, Seligson decided it was the right time to develop an event to celebrate “the new” and to showcase the enormous body of creative and performing talent they had discovered in Southern California during the first decade of Reprise!”  About 45 minutes.

NOTES
: Filmed in 16:9 widescreen, almost no obstructions except for a head on the edge of the widest shots. Only very brief drop-outs for applause. Super fun for fans of the show to see the version before it came to Broadway. This is the only known full video of this pre-Broadway production. Yes, there is a typo in Andrew Keenan-Bolger's name in the video's cast list. Sorry. Audio fed in from external source, so the audio is nice and clear. Do not identify master or exact date.

NOTES
: A rare television find, Evening Primrose is a 1966 musical that aired on ABC Stage 1967 and is most notable for its music and lyrics by a young Stephen Sondheim. The 52-minute black-and-white program was based on a story by John Collier and adapted by James Goldman, and the four songs are distinctively Sondheim.
