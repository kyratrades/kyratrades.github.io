#### Anything Goes - First Broadway Revival - 1988 (Lost Footage) (Highlights)
{: .no_toc .d-inline-block }

Pro-Shot
{: .label .label-green }

Watched
{: .label .label-yellow }

FORMAT
: VOB+smalls `1 DVD` `Footage starts at 1:28:24`

CAST
: Patti LuPone (Reno Sweeney)

NOTES
: Usually labelled as the \"Almost\" Lost Footage of the Lincoln Center Revival from 1988. 20 minutes of footage shot on a single camera from a tripod, on stage right, of the following numbers: \"You\'re the Top,\" \"Easy to Love,\" \"I Want to Row on the Crew\" and \"There\'ll Always be a Lady Fair,\" with dialogue scenes between each song. This is not the poor video quality bootleg that is commonly shared, but is well filmed, with lots of close ups, but some generational loss. It could either have been press reel footage or an archival recording. It usually circulates along with An Evening with Patti LuPone, a PBS television special from 1997 at the Callum Theatre in the Palm Desert Resort hotel in Palm Springs, CA. This lasts around 90 minutes.

NOTES
: At the end of Blow Gabriel, Blow, the audience gives such a rousing ovation that Patti immediately STARTS THE SONG AGAIN from the very beginning.
