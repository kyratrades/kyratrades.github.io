# Videos
{: .no_toc }

### Important
{: .no_toc }

<p align="center"><small>Shows are organised alphabetically (ignoring articles) and all videos are in chronological order under each title, unless I have split them further by tour.</small></p>

<p align="center"><small>I check every single video bootleg for missing files and glitches before listing them onto my site, and will list any issues. Do keep in mind there's still a chance I have missed or mislabelled something, in which case I will offer a replacement and update you when I find the correct copy.</small></p>

<p align="center"><small>If you have a better copy than my existing one (especially the original files) please do contact me about it. I'd love to trade for them!</small></p>

<p align="center"><small>I will include any information I deem relevant (no. of discs, file size, source etc). File size is calculated in gibibytes (1 GB = 1024 MB). Feel free to ask for additional info (e.g. screenshots, files list).</small></p>

<p align="center"><small>Happy trading!</small></p>
