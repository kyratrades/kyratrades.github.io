Wicked - Broadway - January 9, 2004
{: .fw-500 .text-grey-dk-300 .text-gamma .d-inline-block }

FORMAT
: VOB+smalls `1 DVD` `3.79 GB`

CAST
: Idina Menzel (Elphaba), Kristin Chenoweth (Glinda), Taye Diggs (t/r Fiyero), Joel Grey (The Wizard), Carole Shelley (Madame Morrible), Michelle Federer (Nessarose), Christopher Fitzgerald (Boq), William Youmans (Doctor Dillamond)

NOTES
: Restored to the original PAL, though not without a hit from the gen loss incurred along the way. Audio has been filtered to remove the camera noise and excess hiss from the theatre. Image is on the shaky side, and the camera has a hard time locking into focus combined with being out of sync with the US lights leading to a constant flicker. A pity because it's a strong performance by the original cast during the show's ascent.

NOTES
: This is Kristin and Norbert\'s last show. It was also supposed to be Joel Grey\'s last show, but he was ill. Video is sound only for first 4 minutes. This is a great video and excellent sound. Includes the speech by Idina. Definitely the best of the early Wicked captures. Idina wiping tears from Kristin's face is touching and priceless. This bootleg is a treasure.

NOTES
: McIntyre last. This is the infamous show which should have also been Menzel's last, but for her trap door injury the night before. She appears at the very end to make a cameo. Shot from a pronounced angle and wobbly in places but generally watchable.

NOTES
: Act one is complete. Act two isn't, contains the following footage from act two: "Thank Goodness" through setting the monkeys free, then taping starts again moments before "No Good Deed" and then ends after Elphaba melts; excellent video even with all of the missing stuff and some spotlight washout.

NOTES
: About five minutes worth of cover-ups at the beginning (you see Glinda\'s entrance) because of latecomers and few more random ones during the first Act. The first few minutes of the second Act are similar to those of Act One. No obstructions, incredible close-ups (ever wanted to read the board in Dillamond\'s classroom?)

NOTES
: Shoshana\'s, David\'s, Rue\'s and Michelle\'s last performance. The whole cast was really having fun, very high audience energy throughout. Megan and Shoshana have a really funny bit during Popular, and the crowd went wild. Camera wanders quite a bit and is shaky at points due to the master\'s blind filming, plus some spotlight washout. Still, this recording is an absolute gem. Includes playbill scans and Megan's speech in the end.

NOTES
: Quite a lot of spotlight washout, some head obstruction and shakiness. (Not Master\'s notes) The one where Megan hits BOTH optional high notes at the end of No One Mourns the Wicked and Thank Goodness.

NOTES
: Megan Hilty\'s last show in the Broadway run (she will reprise the role of Glinda in the Los Angeles run). A very Megan-centric recording, good close-ups and follows the action very well. Includes detailed scene selection, playbill scans at the start (DVD 1) and stage door recordings (DVD 2). One of, if not the best performance of Megan.

NOTES
: First five minutes of each Act are shaky with cover-ups (I've never seen so many latecomers at a show), and there are also blackouts after some songs in Act One. Incredible close-ups, you can see Eden's tears in her eyes during her heart-wrenching "I'm Not that Girl". Audience is electric, a satisfying show overall. Gaelen, in her early-20s, brings an interesting take on Morrible's role as probably the youngest actress to play her.

NOTES
: Includes pre-show announcement and curtain calls. Also includes the final changes carried over from London , including the abbreviated \'Wonderful\' and the pretty light show replacing the big black hat. Shot from rear mezz, no obstructions. One minute coverup after the ballroom (before Popular) and another during Thank Goodness. Several mic problems cause actor\'s voices to cut out, which causes hilarity when the Wizard\'s head mouths silently in Act Two. Really painful Act One for Julia, especially the end of WAI which is half screamed/sung. She apparently got the frog out of her throat during intermission, because she comes back for a triumphant Act Two. Overall, Julia makes some lovely acting choices and has brilliant chemistry with the rest of the cast, especially Katie and Sebastian; their ALAYM is spell-binding. Will never be a fan of her voice, though. Katie is even better than she was in November. The real standout was Cristy\'s Nessarose\...she has the best voice and gives the most

NOTES
: Very nice video from the orchestra. Can be a little shaky at times, but it\'s a great angle. This was supposed to be Jackie Burns\' last night, but she\'d been sick since late January and ended up missing this performance. Donna is just INCREDIBLE as Elphaba\...

NOTES
: This is a vivid 4K video with almost no obstructions. Pretty much everything is centered, with beautiful zooms but also wider shots that showcase the dancing and set design. At times the video appears on an angle because my wrists are weak, but you don\'t miss anything because of it. There is also washout at times, but I do believe my camera handles the spotlights better than a lot of Wicked videos. All in all this is a gorgeous capture of old and new cast members\... I\'m not finished yet in this bootleg business but if I was this could be my magnum opus.

NOTES
: A nice capture of Laurel taking over as Elphaba and Katie\'s return to Broadway. There\'s a blackout until midway through No One Mourns the Wicked, and the show is full from there, although a head obstructs the far righthand side of the stage. There\'s a couple dropouts every once in a while but the zooms make up for that. Filmed in 16:9, and includes the curtain call.

NOTES

NOTES
: A perfect capture of the current first national tour with some understudies. Emmy is a phenomenal Elphaba with great acting choices and amazing riffs. Very interesting to see a Fiyero mid-show switch; Kyle jumps in to act two seamlessly. One of my best captures with no blackouts, no washout, no obstruction, and very steady filming. This is shot slightly wider than usual, particularly when the ensemble is on stage, so you can see a lot more of the action. There are still close-ups when necessary. As usual, it's filmed in 16:9, and the sound is excellent. Includes curtain call and playbill scans.

: Emma Hunton (Elphaba), Shanon Mari Mills (u/s Glinda), Nick Adams (Fiyero), Tim Kazurinsky (The Wizard), Alison Fraser (Madame Morrible), Jenny Florkowski (Nessarose), Etai BenShlomo (Boq), Tom Flynn (Doctor Dillamond)

NOTES
: This is a great cast \-- Emma brings a fresh new take to the role, a bit snarky and very lovable. There is an interesting blooper when Shanon misses her entrance for One Short Day. Emma and the ensemble perform as usual with Shanon singing her first few lines from off stage until she enters at "I think we've found the place where we belong". A fantastic capture of the show with no obstruction, no washout and only one short blackout during the "Thrillifying News" section. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent, although there's a bit more chatter and rustling from the audience than usual. Includes curtain call and playbill scans.

NOTES

NOTES
: A great capture of the tour before it closed last spring, and the last capture of Emma before she left. Although Emma was actually sick frequently during her run, she seemed to perform flawlessly this night. Chandra also gives a fantastic performance as well. This is perfectly captured with no obstructions, no blackouts, and very little washout even in wide shots. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call, Chandra and Nick's BC/EFA speech, and playbill scans.

NOTES
: Willemijn seemed to be in a bit of a funny mood, she cracked up in Heissgeliebt (Popular) and nearly started laughing in the Catfight. She does a High Witch Cackle in the Cornfield scene, probably to try it for Jana's last the next day. Lucy seemed out to make her laugh even more than usual. Most of Wicked Witch of the East is missing and so is the beginning of March of the Witch Hunters.

NOTES
: Nice capture of the Second National Tour cast, with a big mishap when the power suddenly goes out in the middle of Thank Goodness. Helene and the rest of the cast keep right on going until a crew member comes onstage and stops the show. The DVD includes video of the entire debacle until the curtain goes down, and it continues for a bit after this, then cuts out, then resumes again when the show is picked back up during Wicked Witch of the East. As for the video, the first part of the show is mostly blacked out, but once it gets to The Wizard and I, it\'s much better. The dragon\'s head blocked Marcie\'s face during Defying Gravity, but other than that, there\'s virtually no obstruction. Overall, an amazing capture with no spotlight washout, amazing colour and sound.

NOTES
: First couple minutes of each act are blacked out, but those are the only ones that last more than a few seconds; head obstruction get annoying, but worked around well with a mix of wides, mediums, and closeups throughout the show; little washout, sound is excellent throughout the show. 2 DVDs

NOTES
: Nice video with two heads that obstruct the stage at times but are filmed around and action is rarely blocked. There are only two quick dropouts in each act and some washout in high contrast scenes. It's filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call and playbill scans.

NOTES
: A perfect capture of the brand new tour cast. Kara\'s an excellent Glinda and really tugged at the heart with \"I\'m Not That Girl (Reprise).\" The show is completely intact with no no blackouts, no obstruction, and no washout. The video is very steady throughout and the sound is excellent as usual. It's filmed in 16:9 with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. Includes curtain call and Matt and Emily's very entertaining BC/EFA speech.

NOTES
: Master notes: This is one of my new favorite captures of the show, it follows the action very well for almost being in the front row of the theatre, and gives you a great perspective of the show that DVDs can not often give you. Her vocal and acting choices bring such a fresh twist to Elphaba. There was also a very drunk audience member near me in Act Two, that yells a few drunk remarks that had the audience laughing. Curtain call is included and audio is near perfect, synced with my Zoom H2.

NOTES
: It was Allison's last show as an understudy, before she became lead and Mili's last show. There are several black out periods due to a high usher presence. The only song that are mostly blacked out are The Wizard and I and What is This Feeling. There were a large number of obstructions that occur throughout, but other sections are really good, such as The Wicked Witch of the East and No Good Deed. Lots of good zooms and facials throughout.

NOTES
: Shot with a high quality camera from the balcony. A mix of wide and zooms. Starts a few minutes into no one mourns the wicked. Second act is missing thank goodness and part of governor's mansion--does include wicked witch of the east. Occasional shakiness and waundering, sometimes heads are cut a bit, some whiteouts and bluriness (especially during Defying Gravity camera was just really struggling, sorry!)

Final show for Cèline Purcell and Ferry Doedens. Muck-up where Fiyero flies in with a broom instead of a rifle in Catfight

NOTES
: Amazing pro-shot video of the Mexican production of Wicked! The sets are great and look almost identical to the Broadway set. Elphaba\'s voice was unique, she did ok with a few songs but I struggled with others (esp. the end of DG and NGD). Glinda was great and fun to watch! This also contains interviews and a behind the scenes video.

NOTES
: Very interesting low scale production. Different translation than the recent Mexico City production, but it\'s still okay for the most part. Leads are decent but not great, it is technically a replica production, but the sets are smaller and a lot of the fancier things are left out. Proshot, and induces rehearsal footage. Directed by future Mexican Dr. Dillamond Beto Torres!
