### Trading
I am currently only open to trading for [my wants](https://kyratrades.github.io/wants).

All items listed "NFT" are by the request of the master, I will not trade or sell them.

Online trading only. Contact me through <a href="mailto:kyratrades@gmail.com?subject=Trade%20request">kyratrades@gmail.com</a> with a list of the item(s) you're interested in. Make the list by copying the whole title on my site.

For example:
```yaml
Videos:
1. Wicked - Broadway - May 28, 2006
2. Anything Goes - Third National Tour - March 23, 2013
3. ...

Audios:

2. ...
```

If you already have other means of reaching me, you're welcome to use them too!

### Files
I do my best to check each of my items individually and will note down any issues. Please don’t hesitate to tell me of any problems you've encountered with my files or links, or if I have mislabelled anything.

Feel free to send enquiries about any items listed on my site.

### General wants
These items are an instant trade for me:
- Original files or smalls that I'm missing
- File upgrades to first generation or lower generation copies of DVDs
- Any recordings of Megan Hilty, Stephanie J. Block, and Rachel York that I don't already have

For my specfic wants, please check <a href="https://kyratrades.github.io/wants">this page</a>.

### Links
All the file sizes listed are calculated in gibibytes (1 GB = 1024 MB) - the same method as MEGA, Google Drive and Windows. I mainly use Google Drive for my links, please don’t initiate a trade with me if you have problems with it. If I initiated the trade with you, I am more than happy to upload your requested files to any file sharing service of your choosing.
